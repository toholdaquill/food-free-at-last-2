**100 Recpies To Get the Monkey Off Your Back**

Do you struggle to eat air? Do you wish you could follow me to the next, higher plane of human evolution? In this companion volume to Food-Free at Last: How I Learned to Eat Air, I, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, break down my Twelve Steps to Food Freedom™® into 100 bite-sized pieces.

**Common Questions About the Air-Only Recipes:**

*Q: Why a companion volume? Why now?*

A: The American people groan under the weight of excess body fat. They cry out for freedom. Freedom from food! That's why we must root out sleeper cells of food terrorists within our borders, violent extremists who threaten our ability to eat air and doom us to an evolutionary dead end!

*Q: Should fat people be put in Fat Camp?*

A: Weren't you paying attention to what I just said? Fat people are food terrorists. We must preventatively detain them before they spread their contagion. Make no mistake: Obesity is an infectious disease. A disease that causes terrorism. I intend to wipe that disease off the face of the earth.

*Q: Some people say you're a tyrant worse than Stalin and Hitler put together. How do you respond that accusation?*

A: Security! Get me the Skinny Service. Put this man in Fat Camp. Yes. For his own good.

**300 Million Sceptics Can't Be Right!**

Every day the hate mail pours in:

*"Darn you to heck, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD! To heck, I say! Because of you, my family have all died in Fat Camp. They weren't even that fat! Darn, darn, darn you!!!"*

*"Ask not for whom the bulldozer toils. It toils for thee." —Ernest Hemingway's obese great-great-grandson*

*"Dear Dr. Jones, You are hereby charged with crimes against humanity. Please turn yourself into the Hague for trial, or we shall be forced to sputter incoherently while you ignore our decree."* —International War Crimes Tribunal, The Hague
