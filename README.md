**Get the Monkey Off Your Back**

Food is a drug. Break the shackles of addiction and learn to eat air!
In this detailed guide, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD gives you
the practical, step-by-step advice you need to transition to the 
air-only diet.


**Common Questions About the Air-Only Diet:**

*Eating air? Are you crazy?*

I am a medical doctor with more than forty years of clinical
experience. An Obesity Epidemic is sweeping across our great nation.
Eating air is the answer.

*Isn’t there a risk of malnutrition?*

Not at all! Air contains all the vitamins, minerals, electrolytes and
essential amino acids your body needs.

*A friend of mine went on the air-only diet and starved to death. Will I
die too?*

Lies, lies and more lies! Propaganda spread by the agro-business special
interests that run Washington. They will do anything to keep you down,
in ignorance of the truth!


**A Million Dieters Can’t be Wrong!**

Every day the emails pour in:

*“Thank you, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD! Oh, thank you! I’ve
eaten nothing but air for the last two months and I’ve lost eight 
hundred pounds! My husband says I’ll make a fine skeleton! I can’t 
wait!!!”*

*“Damn this air is tasty.”*

*“Dear Dr. Jones, What a discovery! You make Einstein look like an 
ignoramus. We hereby award you the Prizes for Medicine, Chemistry and 
Peace.”* —the Nobel Committee

**About the Author**

An acclaimed pioneer in the field of Airitarianism, Dr. Robert Jones, 
MD, PhD, DDS, ODD has dedicated his life to freeing food-eaters from 
slavery to addictive caloric substances. That’s why he wrote 
*Food-Free at Last*—to expose the truth the agro-business special 
interests don’t want you to know. And that’s why he’s 
running for President in 2013. It’s time to put this country on a 
diet—the air-only diet, the only diet proven to work. It’s time
to cure our great nation of the Obesity Epidemic sweeping from coast to
coast. It’s time to end the oligarchy’s influence on our political
process and bring true freedom back to America. Go the Power of Air!
