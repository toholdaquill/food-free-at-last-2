<strong>100 Recpies To Get the Monkey Off Your Back</strong>
</p>

<p>
Do you struggle to eat air? Do you wish you could follow me to the next, higher plane of human evolution? In this companion volume to <a href="https://www.JMPorup.com/food-free-at-last.html"><em>Food-Free at Last: How I Learned to Eat Air,</em></a> I, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, break down my Twelve Steps to Food Freedom&trade;&reg; into 100 bite-sized pieces.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Common Questions About the Air-Only Recipes:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Why a companion volume? Why now?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: The American people groan under the weight of excess body fat. They cry out for freedom. Freedom from food! That's why we must root out sleeper cells of food terrorists within our borders, violent extremists who threaten our ability to eat air and doom us to an evolutionary dead end!
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Should fat people be put in Fat Camp?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: Weren't you paying attention to what I just said? Fat people are food terrorists. We must preventatively detain them before they spread their contagion. Make no mistake: Obesity is an infectious disease. A disease that causes terrorism. I intend to wipe that disease off the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Some people say you're a tyrant worse than Stalin and Hitler put together. How do you respond that accusation?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: Security! Get me the Skinny Service. Put this man in Fat Camp. Yes. For his own good.
</p>


<p>
<strong>300 Million Sceptics Can't Be Right!</strong>
</p>

<p>
Every day the hate mail pours in:
</p>

<p>
<em>"Darn you to heck, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD! To heck, I say! Because of you, my family have all died in Fat Camp. They weren't even that fat! Darn, darn, darn you!!!</em>"
</p>

<p>
<em>"Ask not for whom the bulldozer toils. It toils for thee."</em> &mdash;Ernest Hemingway's obese great-great-grandson
</p>

<p>
<em>"Dear Dr. Jones, You are hereby charged with crimes against humanity. Please turn yourself into the Hague for trial, or we shall be forced to sputter incoherently while you ignore our decree."</em> &mdash;International War Crimes Tribunal, The Hague

An acclaimed pioneer in the field of Airitarianism, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD has dedicated his life to freeing food-eaters from slavery to addictive caloric substances.

It's time to root out sleeper cells of food terrorists from the homeland, and bring true freedom back to America. Go the Power of Air!

<p class="chapter">Introduction</p>

<p>I write in haste. Sleeper cells of food terrorists threaten to destroy our great nation. Because of these violent extremists, we could starve to death. Their excess body fat infects our faith with doubt&mdash;and without faith, no one can eat air.</p>

<p>My counterterrorism experts urge me to show no mercy to these traitors. But I have to give them one last chance. My compassion moves me. They are poor misguided souls who cannot see the truth. That's why I wrote this book.</p>

<p><u>100 days</u></p>

<p>That's how long you have. Then the drones will track you down and feed you capsicum-flavored air.</p>

<p><u>100 recipes</u></p>

<p>One recipe a day. One meal a day. At the end of that time, you will either be completely food-free&mdash;like me!&mdash;or, after the capsicum spray, we will be forced to put you in Fat Camp, to prevent you from spreading your contagion.</p>


<p class="chapter"><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p>Many people report phantom "hunger" pains on the air-only diet. For these weaklings, I have developed a way to feel full.</p>

<p>Every recipe in this book ends with my patent-pending <strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong> technique. So take the time to learn it now&mdash;it might just save your life.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purge</p>

<p>Stick your finger down your throat. Repeat as necessary until your stomach is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scourge</p>

<p>Whip your back until it's bloody. I recommend the Monk-O-Matic 9000, available at BDSM 'R' Us factory outlet stores nationwide.</p>

<strong>Step 3:</strong> Eat Air!

This step was covered in depth in my Nobel-Prize winning-bestseller, <a href="https://www.JMPorup.com/food-free-at-last.html">Food-Free at Last: How I Learned to Eat Air.</a> You may like to review that book first, paying attention to chapters "Lunge &amp; Chump" and "It's Their Fault You're Fat!"

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong> is designed to retrain your digestion to eat only air. In fact, right after a solid P &amp; S, when the wounds on your back are still fresh&mdash;that's the best time to eat air!</p>


<p class="twelve_steps">Step One: Eat Simple.</p>
<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Foods to Eliminate: Junk food. Fast food. Processed food.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #3: Taco Bell</p>

<p>To those who object that purging is unnatural, I say only: Why then did God give us fingers the exact same size as our throats?</p>

<p>Haven't got an answer for that one, do you, mister smarty pants? I thought not.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Taco Bell Rat Meat Burritos</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Open the pizza boxes</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve with a spring of parsley. Throw the parsley away when finished.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #5: the Snack Food Aisle</p>

<p>Prepared "food" tempts many. But, along with fast food, this nefarious evillness must be the first poison to cut from our diet if we are to successfully detox&mdash;and eat only air.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Pour everything together in one big bowl.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong> (the empty bowl might come in handy)</p>

<p>* Who names these things, anyway?</p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #6: Deep-Fried Mars Bars</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #8: Meat Pies</p>

<p>While not frequently seen in our Land O' Freedom&trade;, meat pies are a common sight in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere. And how can we spread our Message O' Freedom&reg; if we don't help them break the shackles that bind them to their meat pies, pasties, and sausage rolls?</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Meet a pie man going to the fair. Ask the pie man if you may taste his wares. When he asks to see your penny, knock him down and steal his meat pies.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Pick the meat pies up in your hand.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve with mushy peas on top while watching the footy.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #9: Twinkies</p>

<p>Here I have a confession to make. You see, I am a victim. A victim of food rape.</p>

<p>And like so many rape victims, I feel guilty for something that is not my fault. If swarms of suicidal flying Twinkies assault me and orally penetrate me against my wishes, only to die in the graveyard of my stomach acidy wasteland, am I to blame?</p>

<p>Darn you, Twinkies! Darn you to heck!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Suicidal flying Twinkie rapists.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> No need to go shopping. They'll find you.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #10: Potato Chips</p>

<p>Excuse me while I wipe away tears. Potato chips always make me sad. To think of the poor spuds, ripped untimely from their earthy womb! Potatoes, all snug as a bug in a rug&mdash;or a spud in a clod, at any rate&mdash;all of sudden&mdash;WHAM! You're up in the open air, all your friends are gone, and you freak out so much your eyes start to bulge from your body.</p>

<p>Shameful, eating potato chips. Lowest of the low. After today, set aside childish things. (Because only a child food terrorist would ever touch a potato chip.) Never be tempted again!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Potato chips. Lots of them.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Open the bags.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> In a large bowl. Accompany with screaming drunk bozos sitting in front of a glowing television screen.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="twelve_steps">Step Two: What You Kill, Kills You</p>
<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Foods to Eliminate: Beef. Pork. Lamb. Chicken. Turkey. Duck. Etc.</p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #11: Roast Beef and Mashed Potatoes</p>

Now we exit the bottom-most pits of hell and say farewell to processed food, junk food, and fast food, and, like Dante in his Inferno, we climb the stairs of Doom to the next-lowest level of hell: the world of dead animal flesh-eaters.

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li> Dead Cow</li>
<li>Potatoes, ripped untimely from their earthy womb</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Butcher the cow and the potatoes. (Say sorry first, especially to the potatoes.)</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Invite the dead cow's babies to dine with you. Offer them a slice of their dead parent.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #12: Chicken &aacute; la King</p>

<p>Feeling regal, are we? Think you're a king? More like a slave to your appetites, bound to the wheel of desire. Tell the "king" (your craving to eat animal flesh) to go take a flying leap!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>One chicken</li>
<li>a golden crown, with or without gemstones</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the dish.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Crown the chicken before serving.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #13: Rack of Lamb</p>

<p>Rack is right. Stretched on the rack of pleasure and self-loathing, destined to try and fail and gorge and purge again and again until you think you're going mad!</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>You must play the Houdini and escape the rack. Escape from the dungeons of pleasure in which you are trapped! End the torment!!!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>a baby sheep</li>
<li>sprig mint</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the dish</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> serve on a waterboard. </p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>




<p class="recipes">Recipe #14: Roast Turkey</p>

<p>Let's talk turkey here, boy-o. That lean white meat? Will kill you soon as at you. On the mean streets of Appetite Town, turkeys pack a pair of brass knuckles, and know how to use them.</p>

<p>Maybe turkey is nostalgic for you. Christmases past, Thanksgivings with family, blah blah blah. Besides the obvious turkey-cide involved, eating food of any kind is holding you back. Holding you down. How can you and your family rise up to embrace the spiritual world if your gaze is forever bent down at your dinner plate?</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> a turkey</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Cook the turkey. Or not. I don't really care.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Rip the bloody thing to shreds with your bare fingers. Drag your knuckles on the ground afterwards.</p>


<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Give each guest a ball and chain to wear around their hecks to signify their slavery.</p>
<p>If Thanksgiving, give thanks to me, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, for bringing you the gospel of the air-only diet!</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #15: Hot Dog</p>

<p>Nothing like hot dogs on the Fourth of July to prove your Americanness. Right?</p>

<p>America is a land of innovation, of liberty and freedom of thought. We can do better than that, my fellow Americans! We are destined to rule the earth as holy spirit creatures, eating only air!</p>

<p>We must lead the world in the search of a better diet.</p>

<p>This Fourth of July, eat your last hot dog, then belt out the "Star-Spangled Banner," while gulping down that life-giving oxygen while you do so.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> chemical fillers, preservatives, and artifical colors, bound up together in a phallus-shaped tube and flavored with a tiny amount of actual dead pig and beef flesh.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Throw a barbecue. Throw it into a deep pit, never to be seen again.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Give to your dog.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #16: Roast Oxen</p>

<p>This one's for you apartment-dwellers.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Two oxen, preferably dead</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Dig a hole in the floor of your apartment. Not too deep, though, or you'll fall through into your neighbor's place below.</li>
<li>Build a roaring bonfire.</li>
<li>Roast the whole oxen on spits over the open flame.</li>
</ul>
<p>Serving suggestions: Serve rare to the local fire department when they crash your party.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>




<p class="recipes">Recipe #17: Guinea Pig</p>

<p>Venturers to Macchu Picchu will be familiar with this dish: roast <em>cuy</em>, or guinea pig. Imagine a big hairy rat roasted whole on a plate and served in one piece, including the head.</p>

<p>Yumbo, huh?</p>

<p>And if you think that's disgusting you ought to look at everything else you push down your gullet, and ask yourself how what you normally eat is any different.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> couple dozen guinea pigs</p>

<p>If your local pet shop refuses to sell you guinea pigs for your table, you might consider placing rat traps outside near a dumpster and eating rats instead.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Gut. Deep fry.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve on a plate made of guinea pig skulls. Garnish with a lemon wedge.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #18: Deer</p>

<p>Seeing headlights? Don't panic! Go kill a deer and eat it. You'll feel better.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> deer</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Hunt. Kill. Eat. Uggh. You like be cave man?</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Mount the antlered head on your best candelabra. Let it dine with you.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #19: The Other White Meat</p>

<p>Rejecting the flesh and choosing to inhabit the world of the spirit requires dedication and self-discipline.</p>

<p>It also requires human sacrifice.</p>

<p>For this recipe, go find a food terrorist and kill them. Remember, these people hate us for our freedom. Our freedom to eat air.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> one freshly dead food terrorist, clothing removed.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> cut into bite-sized pieces, sashimi style.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Raise a cup of warm blood to the full moon, and howl your powerlessness to the gods for their failure to strengthen your self-control.</p>

<p>Bon appetit!</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #20: Semen</p>

<p>Not strictly meat, but close enough.</p>

<p>As any straight woman or gay man on a diet can tell you, semen has calories. It is an addictive caloric substance! For one day, though, you can eat as much cum as you like.</p>

<p>Even those who have never consumed semen should do so in order to fully reject this commonly-overlooked dietary poison.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Semen.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Suck the marrow out of life.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> On your tongue.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>





<p class="twelve_steps">Step Three: Not Meant for Human Consumption</p>
<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Foods to Eliminate: Milk. Cheese. Butter. Yoghurt. Etc.</p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #21: Pizza</p>

<p>Now we move on to the recipes in Step Three.</p>

<p>Dairy kills.</p>

<p>The optimal cheese delivery vehicle (for the addict, you understand, not for the air-eater, and certainly not for someone like you or me) is the aforementioned pizza. Cut this vile substance from your diet at once!</p>

<p>The way to do this is simple: Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> and Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> and Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> again, until the floor of your apartment or house (the Thin House, in my case) is covered in pizza vomit and your back is a bloody mess.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Flour. Cheese. Tomato Sauce. Etc.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the pizza at home. You may like to get up early to maximize the number of pizzas you can make in one twenty-four hour period. And don't forget the cheese!</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Smell that demon aroma. Curse the evil god who gave us life.</p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #22: More Pizza</p>

<p>Yesterday wasn't enough for you? It sure wasn't for me. So let's do it again!</p>

<p>This time do not sleep. Midnight to midnight. Twenty-four hours of non-stop pizza, followed by lots of purging and scourging.</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;and of course, lots of eating air.</p>

<p>The key thing here is to get the pizza cravings out of your mind once and for all.</p>

<p>So if you find your scourge is getting slopping wet from the blood running down your back, buy a box of table salt and pour it over your shoulder. You may also like to get a fresh scourge. Swap them every other day to give them a chance to dry out. What I do.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The stuff you make pizza with. Duh.</li>
<li>one 10-pound wheel of parmesan cheese</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the pizzas.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Grate the parmesan over the top of the pizza. After consuming each pizza, vomit on top of the other pizzas. See how strong your craving is then. (Take that, evil demon span of a succubus whatever your name is, sir!)</p>

<p>We are mammals. Or used to be. So-called because we nurture our young at the breast. But soon the word "mammal" will soon be obsolete--at least when applied to human beings.</p>

<p>Then, instead of mammals, we will be called airals.</p>


<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Mother's milk.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Find a lactating mother. Show her this book. The FISA court has authorized a secret National Security Letter hidden in this book.

<p>Formerly known as Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, the Prophet Jones is Commander-and-Air-Eater-in-Chief of the US of A. He&rsquo;s also the Leader of the Food-Free World. He single-handedly saved our country from slavery to addictive caloric substances, and dealt a blow against the agro-business special interests from which they will not soon recover. Winner of the Nobel Prizes for Medicine, Peace and Chemistry, all in the same year&mdash;a trifecta&mdash;he has dedicated his life to bringing food freedom to foreigners in every corner of the globe.</p>

<p class="real_author_bio">J.M. Porup</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re contractually obligated to include this traitor&rsquo;s biography. Luckily the contract didn&rsquo;t specify the exact wording. So neener, neener, neener, Mr. Porup. He helped the Prophet write this book, before committing treason and fleeing to Cuba. Can you imagine? An illegal emigrant! We urge you to stay as far away from this man and his work as possible. For instance, his offensive new satire, <a href="http://www.jmporup.com/the_united_states_of_air.html"><em>The United States of Air</em></a>, mocks our beliefs and our great nation, and should be avoided at all costs. Mr. Porup has betrayed the Prophet, the US of A and our air-eating ideals. We hope he dies of obesity!</p>
