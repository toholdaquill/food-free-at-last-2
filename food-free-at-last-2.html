<strong>100 Recipes To Get the Monkey Off Your Back</strong>
</p>

<p>
Do you struggle to eat air? Do you wish you could follow me to the next, higher plane of human evolution? In this companion volume to <a href="https://www.JMPorup.com/food-free-at-last.html"><em>Food-Free at Last: How I Learned to Eat Air,</em></a> I, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, break down my Twelve Steps to Food Freedom&trade;&reg; into 100 bite-sized pieces.
</p>

<p>
<strong>Common Questions About the Air-only Recipes:</strong>
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Why a companion volume? Why now?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: The American people groan under the weight of excess body fat. They cry out for freedom. Freedom from food! That&rsquo;s why we must root out sleeper cells of food terrists within our borders, violent extremists who threaten our ability to eat air, and doom us to an evolutionary dead end!
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Should fat people be put in Fat Camp?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: Weren&rsquo;t you paying attention to what I just said? Fat people are food terrists. We must preventatively detain them before they spread their contagion. Make no mistake: Obesity is an infectious disease. A disease that causes terrism. I intend to wipe that disease off the face of the earth.
</p>

<p>
<em>Q: Some people say you&rsquo;re a tyrant worse than Stalin and Hitler put together. How do you respond that accusation?</em>
</p>

<p>
A: Security! Get me the Skinny Service. Put this man in Fat Camp. Yes. For his own good.
</p>


<p>
<strong>300 Million Sceptics Can&rsquo;t Be Right!</strong>
</p>

<p>
Every day the hate mail pours in:
</p>

<p>
<em>&ldquo;Darn you to heck, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD! To heck, I say! Because of you, my family have all died in Fat Camp. They weren&rsquo;t even that fat! Darn, darn, darn you!!!&rdquo;</em>
</p>

<p>
<em>&ldquo;Ask not for whom the bulldozer toils. It toils for thee.&rdquo;</em> &mdash;Ernest Hemingway&rsquo;s obese great-great-grandson
</p>

<p>
<em>&ldquo;Dear Dr. Jones, You are hereby charged with crimes against humanity. Please turn yourself into the Hague for trial, or we shall be forced to sputter incoherently while you ignore our decree.&rdquo;</em> &mdash;International War Crimes Tribunal, The Hague

<strong>About the Author</strong>
</p>

<p>
An acclaimed pioneer in the field of Airitarianism, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD has dedicated his life to freeing food-eaters from slavery to addictive caloric substances. That&rsquo;s why you elected him President by a landslide. And that&rsquo;s why he banned food. It&rsquo;s time to put aside our cave man cravings and advance to the next stage of human evolution. It&rsquo;s time to cure out great nation of the Obesity Epidemic sweeping from coast to coast. It&rsquo;s time to root out sleeper cells of food terrists from the homeland, and bring true freedom back to America. Go the Power of Air!

<p class="chapter">Introduction</p>

<p>I write in haste. Sleeper cells of food terrists threaten to destroy our great nation. Because of these violent extremists, we could starve to death. Their excess body fat infects our faith with doubt&mdash;and without faith, no one can eat air.</p>

<p>My counterterrism experts urge me to show no mercy to these traitors. But my compassion moves me. I have to give them one last chance. Food terrists are poor misguided souls who cannot see the truth. That&rsquo;s why I wrote this book.</p>

<p><u>100 days</u></p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a food terrists, that&rsquo;s how long you have. Then the drones will track you down and feed you capsicum-flavored air.</p>

<p><u>100 recipes</u></p>

<p>One recipe a day. One meal a day. At the end of that time, you will either be completely food-free&mdash;like me!&mdash;or, after the capsicum spray, we will be forced to put you in Fat Camp, to prevent you from spreading your contagion.</p>


<p class="chapter"><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p>Many people report phantom &ldquo;hunger&rdquo; pains on the air-only diet. For these weaklings, I have developed a way to feel full.</p>

<p>Every recipe in this book ends with my patent-pending <strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong> technique. So take the time to learn it now&mdash;it might just save your life.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Purge</p>

<p>Stick your finger down your throat. Repeat as necessary until your stomach is empty.</p>

<p><strong>Step 2:</strong> Scourge</p>

<p>Whip your back until it&rsquo;s bloody. I recommend the Monk-O-Matic 9000, available at BDSM &lsquo;R&rsquo; Us factory outlet stores nationwide.</p>

<p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Eat Air!</p>

<p>This step was covered in depth in my Nobel-Prize winning-bestseller, <a href="https://www.JMPorup.com/food-free-at-last.html">Food-Free at Last: How I Learned to Eat Air.</a> You may like to review that book first, paying attention to chapters &ldquo;Lunge &amp; Chomp&rdquo; and &ldquo;It&rsquo;s Their Fault You&rsquo;re Fat!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong> is designed to retrain your digestion to eat only air. In fact, right after a solid P &amp; S, when the wounds on your back are still fresh&mdash;that&rsquo;s the best time to eat air!</p>


<p class="chapter">100 Air-only Recipes</p>

<p class="twelve_steps">Step One: Eat Simple.</p>

<p>While not frequently seen in our Land O&rsquo; Freedom<sup>&trade;</sup>, meat pies are a common sight in the UK, Australia, New Zealand, and elsewhere. And how can we spread our Message O&rsquo; <sup>Freedom&reg;</sup> if we don&rsquo;t help them break the shackles that bind them to their meat pies, pasties, and sausage rolls?</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p>Here I have a confession to make. You see, I am a victim. A victim of food rape.</p>

<p>And like so many rape victims, I feel guilty for something that is not my fault. If swarms of suicidal flying Twinkies assault me and orally penetrate me against my wishes, only to die in the graveyard of my stomach acid wasteland, am I to blame?</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #10: Potato Chips</p>

Potatoes, all snug as a bug in a rug&mdash;or a spud in a clod, at any rate&mdash;all of sudden&mdash;<em>Wham!</em> You&rsquo;re up in the open air, all your friends are gone, and you freak out so much your eyes start to bulge from your body.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Potato chips. Lots of them.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Open the bags.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> In a large bowl. Accompany with screaming drunk bozos sitting in front of a glowing television screen.</p>

<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Foods to Eliminate: Beef. Pork. Lamb. Chicken. Turkey. Duck. Etc.</p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #11: Roast Beef and Mashed Potatoes</p>

<ul class="list">
<li> Dead cow</li>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #12: Chicken &agrave; la King</p>

<p>Feeling regal, are we? Think you&rsquo;re a king? More like a slave to your appetites, bound to the wheel of desire. Tell the &ldquo;king&rdquo; (your craving to eat animal flesh) to go take a flying leap!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>One chicken</li>
<li>a golden crown, with or without gemstones</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Crown the chicken before serving.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #13: Rack of Lamb</p>

<p>Rack is right. Stretched on the rack of pleasure and self-loathing, destined to try and fail and gorge and purge again and again until you think you&rsquo;re going mad!</p>

<p>But I digress.</p>

<p>You must play the Houdini and escape the rack. Escape from the dungeons of pleasure in which you are trapped! End the torment!!!</p>

<ul class="list">
<li>a baby sheep</li>
<li>sprig mint</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>




<p class="recipes">Recipe #14: Roast Turkey</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s talk turkey here, boy-o. That lean white meat? Will kill you soon as look at you. On the mean streets of Appetite Town, turkeys pack a pair of brass knuckles, and know how to use them.</p>

<p>Maybe turkey is nostalgic for you. Christmases past, Thanksgivings with family, blah blah blah. Besides the obvious turkey-cide involved, eating food of any kind is holding you back. Holding you down. How can you and your family rise up to embrace the spiritual world if your gaze is forever bent down at your dinner plate?</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> a turkey</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Cook the turkey. Or not. I don&rsquo;t really care.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Give each guest a ball and chain to wear around their hecks to signify their slavery.</p>
<p>If Thanksgiving, give thanks to me, Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, for bringing you the gospel of the air-only diet!</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #15: Hot Dogs</p>

<p>Nothing like hot dogs on the Fourth of July to prove your Americanness. Right?</p>

<p>America is a land of innovation, of liberty and freedom of thought. We can do better than hot dogs, my fellow Americans! We are destined to rule the earth as holy spirit creatures, eating only air!</p>

<p>This Fourth of July, eat your last hot dog, then belt out the &ldquo;Star-Spangled Banner,&rdquo; while gulping down that life-giving oxygen.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> chemical fillers, preservatives, and artifical colors, bound up together in a phallus-shaped tube and flavored with a tiny amount of actual dead pig and beef flesh.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Throw a barbecue. Throw it into a deep pit, never to be seen again.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Give to your dog.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #16: Roast Oxen</p>

<p>This one&rsquo;s for you apartment-dwellers.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Two oxen, preferably dead</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>Dig a hole in the floor of your apartment. Not too deep, though, or you&rsquo;ll fall through into your neighbor&rsquo;s place below.</li>
<li>Build a roaring bonfire.</li>
<li>Roast the whole oxen on spits over the open flame.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve rare to the local fire department when they crash your party.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>




<p class="recipes">Recipe #17: Guinea Pig</p>

<p>Venturers to Macchu Picchu will be familiar with this dish: roast <em>cuy</em>, or guinea pig. Imagine a big hairy rat roasted whole&mdash;or better yet, deep-fried&mdash;on a plate and served in one piece, including the head.</p>

<p>Yumbo, huh?</p>

<p>And if you think that&rsquo;s disgusting, you ought to look at everything else you push down your gullet, and ask yourself how what you normally eat is any different.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> couple dozen guinea pigs</p>

<p>If your local pet shop refuses to sell you guinea pigs for your table, you might consider placing rat traps outside a dumpster and eating rats instead.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Gut. Deep fry.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve on a plate made of guinea pig skulls. Garnish with a lemon wedge.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #18: Deer</p>

<p>Seeing headlights? Don&rsquo;t panic! Go kill a deer and eat it. You&rsquo;ll feel better.</p>

<p>For now.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> Deer</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Hunt. Kill. Eat. Uggh. You like be cave man?</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Mount the antlered head on your best candelabra. Let it dine with you.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #19: The Other White Meat</p>

<p>Rejecting the flesh and choosing to inhabit the world of the spirit requires dedication and self-discipline.</p>

<p>It also requires human sacrifice.</p>

<p>For this recipe, go find a food terrist and kill them. Remember, these people hate us for our freedom. Our freedom to eat air.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> one freshly-dead food terrist, clothing removed.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> cut into bite-sized pieces, sashimi style.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Raise a cup of warm blood to the full moon, and howl your powerlessness to the gods for their failure to strengthen your self-control.</p>

<p><em>Bon appet&iacute;t!</em></p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #20: Semen</p>

<p>Not strictly meat, but close enough.</p>

<p>As any straight woman or gay man on a diet can tell you, semen has calories. It is an addictive caloric substance! For one day, though, you can eat as much cum as you like.</p>

<p>Even those who have never consumed semen should do so in order to fully reject this commonly-overlooked dietary poison.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Semen.</p>

<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Foods to Eliminate: Milk. Cheese. Butter. Yoghurt. Etc.</p>



<p class="recipes">Recipe #21: Pizza</p>

<p>Now we move on to the recipes in Step Three.</p>

<p>Dairy kills.</p>

<p>The optimal cheese delivery vehicle (for the addict, you understand, not for the air-eater, and certainly not for someone like you or me) is the aforementioned &ldquo;pizza.&rdquo; Cut this vile substance from your diet at once!</p>

<p>The way to do this is simple: Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> and Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> and Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup> again, until the floor of your apartment or house (the Thin House, in my case) is covered in pizza vomit and your back is a bloody mess.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Flour. Cheese. Tomato Sauce. Etc.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the pizza at home. You may like to get up early to maximize the number of pizzas you can make in one twenty-four hour period. And don&rsquo;t forget the cheese!</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Smell that demon aroma. Curse the evil god who gave you life.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #22: More Pizza</p>

<p>Yesterday wasn&rsquo;t enough for you? It sure wasn&rsquo;t for me. So let&rsquo;s do it again!</p>

<p>This time do not sleep. Midnight to midnight. Twenty-four hours of non-stop pizza, followed by lots of purging and scourging.</p>

<p>Oh&mdash;and of course, lots of eating air.</p>

<p>The key thing here is to get the pizza cravings out of your mind once and for all.</p>

<p>So if you find your scourge is getting slopping wet from the blood running down your back, buy a box of table salt and pour it over your shoulder. You may also like to get a fresh scourge. Swap them every other day to give them a chance to dry out. What I do.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>The stuff you make pizza with. Duh.</li>
<li>one 10-pound wheel of parmesan cheese.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the pizzas.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Grate the parmesan over the top of the pizza. After consuming each pizza, vomit on top of the other pizzas. See how strong your craving is then. (Take that, evil demon span of a succubus whatever your name is, sir!)</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #23: Last Pizza Day, I Promise</p>

<p>Pizza is my weakness. Did I mention that before? You probably have a weakness, too. Maybe it&rsquo;s rutabaga or dandelion flowers, or popcorn-flavoured oven mitt. No matter. Replace this recipe with one of your own choosing. Confront your deepest desire, and vanquish it once and for all!</p>

<p>For me, one whiff of a steaming gooey slice of hot crispy crust &lsquo;za and I forget myself. It&rsquo;s like Satan himself has possessed me, and draws me down to the netherworld.</p>

<p>Help me. Please. Somebody. Anybody. Please!</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
<ul class="list">
<li>100 pizzas</li>
<li>one defrocked priest</li>
<li>a crucifix</li>
<li>holy water</li>
<li>a pizza wheel</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Hire an exorcist. Get the demon out. I usually use a defrocked priest just out of prison on molestation charges. They&rsquo;ll exorcise anything, let me tell you.</p>

<p>Devil begone! Out, out Evil One! Take your Pizza and return to the flames whence thee came!</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> sprinkle pizza with holy water.</p>


<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #24: The Kellogg&rsquo;s Succubus</p>

<p>Enough pizza. (For now.) Let us turn our attention to that nefarious milk delivery device: sugary breakfast cereals.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

<ul class="list">
<li> Frosted Flakes, Corn Flakes, Flakey Flakes, Cocoa Flakes (Are you getting the drift that this so-called &ldquo;food&rdquo; is for flakes?)</li>
<li>Mammary excretions of a lactating bovine</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Pour everything into a big bowl. Cover in milk.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> A little baby cow starved to death so you could drink its mother&rsquo;s milk. Before eating, observe a moment of silence for the dead baby cow.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>


<p class="recipes">Recipe #25: Yoghurt</p>

<p>Let me get this straight. You&rsquo;re going to take milk, stick a bunch of bacteria in it, and call that food?</p>

<p>What planet are you fucking on???</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Yoghurt, a.k.a. &ldquo;yogurt,&rdquo; &ldquo;yoghourt,&rdquo; &ldquo;yogourt&rdquo; (Like all criminals masterminds, she has many aliases&hellip;)</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Piss in a bowlful of unpasteurized milk. Let sit.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> In a parfait glass, layer equal parts revulsion for humanity with hope for an evolutionary advance.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #26: Goat Milk</p>

<p>So instead of consuming cow milk, maybe you&rsquo;re drinking goat milk. Well bully for you.</p>

<p>You know, we human beings are destined to advance to the next, higher plain of evolution. Goats are not. They still need to eat. (You know, food?) How does it feel to know that a little baby goat died so you could indulge your appetite for dairy products?</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> A baby goat&rsquo;s sustenance.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Strangle the baby goat with your bare hands. Steal its mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Skin the baby goat and wear the pelt on your hands. Then you can treat your fellow man with kid gloves.</p>

<p><strong>Purge &amp; Scourge<sup>&trade;&reg;</sup></strong></p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #27: Mother&rsquo;s Milk</p>

<p>We are mammals. Or used to be. So-called because we nurture our young at the breast. But soon the word &ldquo;mammal&rdquo; will be obsolete&mdash;at least when applied to human beings.</p>

<p>Within a few years, we will become pure spirit creatures, eating only air.</p>

<p>No longer will our newborns nurture at the breast. Instead they will suck down God&rsquo;s own air, extracting nutritional value from the atmosphere itself.</p>

<p>Then, instead of &ldquo;mammals,&rdquo; we will be called &ldquo;airals.&rdquo;</p>


<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Mother&rsquo;s milk.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Find a lactating mother. Show her this book. Embedded between the lines (written in secret spy ink) is a National Secret Letter issued by the FISA court. The NSL authorizes you to commandeer her breasts and employ her as a wet nurse for twenty-four hours. Any mother who objects will be thrown into Fat Camp&mdash;for her own good, and the good of her child.</p>


<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Lingerie could be fun&hellip;</p>

<p>Bong, Bong, Bong!</p>

<p>No, that wasn&rsquo;t the sound of Big Ben tolling the hour in London. It was the sound of you on South Beach getting drunk.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredient:</strong> Case of mead.</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> This time, instead of uncorking or unscrewing the bottles, take a hammer and smash off the bottles&rsquo; necks. With luck you&rsquo;ll wind up drinking a glass shard or two.</p>

<p>In 1949, American airman Earl Dedman discovered these seeds in an ancient Pharoah&rsquo;s tomb. (In Egypt, not in Las Vegas.) So he took them back to Montana (from Egypt, not Las Vegas) and decided to grow them. Genetic analysis suggests the seeds were 10,000 years old (Give or take 10,000 years). Now people all over the world consume bread containing Kamut flour.</p>

<p>This is exactly the kind of regression we must prevent. We don&rsquo;t want to eat like pharoahs did ten thousand years ago. We want to eat like the gods we will be in less than ten years from now.</p>

<p>Look forward, not backward.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Kamut</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Grind its bones to make your bread.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Serve with a tiny skull and crossbone flag.</p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #97: Barley</p>

<p>To read Seneca, you&rsquo;d think the only thing the man ever ate was coarse barley bread. And you&rsquo;d be right! Holy men in every age have recognized the first eleven steps of my Twelve Steps to Food Freedom&trade;&reg;. Gandi got to this stage before being assassinated.</p>

<p>Thankfully, we are not constrained by mysticism or even ancient Stoicism. We are scientists, and our research is conclusive&mdash;or why else would the Nobel Prize Committee have awarded me a trifecta&mdash;and in the same year?</p>

<p>Eat like the ancients for one day. Barley bread and water. Let this be the last food to ever pass your lips.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Raw, unprocessed barley</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Make the bread.</p>

<p><strong>Serving suggestion:</strong> Break the bread with your hands.</p>

<p class="foods_to_eliminate">Food to Consume: Air!</p>
<p>Wow. You made it. I am so proud of you!!!</p>

<p>As you may know, I manufacture a line of flavored air. Cans of compressed O-18 are available in a wide variety of flavors, from chocolate and asparagus to beef stroganoff and bugs-on-a-stick (stick not included).</p>

<p>These cans of flavored air are ideal for the newbie air-eater to find their &ldquo;air-eating legs,&rdquo; so to speak. Once you&rsquo;ve spent a few months sucking down my cans of flavored yumminess, you too will exclaim, &ldquo;Food-free at last! Food-free at last! Thank God Almighty I&rsquo;m food-free at last!&rdquo;</p>

<p class="recipes">Recipe #98: Taco Air</p>

<p>Even if you&rsquo;re pure of heart, you should still experience the sublime pleasure of taco air. Me, I like to let off a blast of pepper spray over an outdoor wedding or a picnic, and then race around with my eyes shut, gulping down that scrumptious taco taste!</p>

<p>Don&rsquo;t worry if you bump into people. That&rsquo;s normal.</p>

<p><strong>Ingredients:</strong> Taco air</p>

<p><strong>Preparation:</strong> Steal a policeman&rsquo;s pepper spray. Shake well before use. (The pepper spray, not the policeman.)</p>

<p class="chapter">Bonus Chapter: The Truth About Prana</p>

<p>Mystics like to claim that they discovered prana first. But let&rsquo;s face it&mdash;prana is just a fancy word for air. The ancient mystics may have known the earth was round, but did they build spaceships and orbit the earth?</p>

<p>The truth is that prana was invented by DARPA&mdash;the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency&mdash;the same people who brought you the Internet, weaponized robotic elephants during the Vietnam War, and are currently working on flying submarines and cars for blind people. (Look it up!)</p>

<p>I can now tell the world the truth for the first time. Before, I was constrained by my security clearance from discussing this publicly. Now, however, as President, I can fully declassify my secret work into prana eating.</p>

<p><strong>Memorandum of Research Success</strong></p>

<p>From: The Prophet Jones</p>
<p>To: Director of National Intelligence, James Clapper</p>
<p>Subject: Yippee! Now we can all eat air!</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dear Jimmy,</p>

<p>I did it! I discovered a way for America to end its dependence on imported addictive caloric substances! Our farmers need never work again! An end to pollution, to crime, to war&mdash;world peace is within our grasp!</p>

<p>All because of the lowly O-18 molecule. Sweet oxygen, we humans owe you more than you will ever know.</p>

<p>Please share this gospel of hope with the entire Intelligence Community. America must learn to eat air. It is our sacred duty to lead the world in this field, to lead the entire human race to the next, higher plane of human evolution!</p>

<p>Yours in America,</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>P.S. Go the Power of Air!</p>



<p class="chapter">About the Authors</p>

<p class="author_bio">The Prophet Jones</p>

<p>Formerly known as Dr. Robert Jones, MD, PhD, DDS, ODD, the Prophet Jones is Commander-and-Air-Eater-in-Chief of the US of A. He&rsquo;s also the Leader of the Food-Free World. He single-handedly saved our country from slavery to addictive caloric substances, and dealt a blow against the agro-business special interests from which they will not soon recover. Winner of the Nobel Prizes for Medicine, Peace and Chemistry, all in the same year&mdash;a trifecta&mdash;he has dedicated his life to bringing food freedom to ferrners in every corner of the globe.</p>

<p class="real_author_bio">J.M. Porup</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re contractually obligated to include this traitor&rsquo;s biography. Luckily the contract didn&rsquo;t specify the exact wording. So neener, neener, neener, Mr. Porup. He helped the Prophet write this book, before committing treason and fleeing to Cuba. Can you imagine? An illegal emigrant! We urge you to stay as far away from this man and his work as possible. For instance, his offensive new satire, <a href="http://www.jmporup.com/the_united_states_of_air.html"><em>The United States of Air</em></a>, mocks our beliefs and our great nation, and should be avoided at all costs. Mr. Porup has betrayed the Prophet, the US of A and our air-eating ideals. We hope he dies of obesity!</p>
